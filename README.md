`pip install pyinstaller`

Once `pyinstaller` is installed, you can build the executable file using the following command:

`pyinstaller -F mkpoj.py`

This command will generate a folder named "mkproj" that contains the executable file for your operating system.

## Usage
To use the program, simply run the executable file generated in the "dist" folder.

### Note:
 You need to add the path of the dist folder to your system's environmental variables for the program to work properly.
